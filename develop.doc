MediumC. Code development details.
 
The operation of the MediumC compiler is based on linked list approach.
There are two lists controlling the compilation:

glbsym - responsible for global declarations,  
locsym - responsible for compound statement declarations.

glbsym exists throughout the entire compilation phase. Items are
added to the list as they are processed in input file.
locsym exist only during processing of a compound statement.
Recursive compound statements are processed as sections in locsym.
When a particular statement is processed its section is trimmed off
from the locysm.  

Both lists consist of the root element:
typedef struct list{
  entry *start;		/* start of the list */
  entry *end;		/* end of the list */
  int entries;		/* # of entries */
};

and elements:

typedef struct entry{
  char name[NAMEMAX];	/* name of the item */
  T_storage storage;	/* storage type */
  T_type type;		/* type of the element */
  T_ident ident;	/* ident */
  unsigned int size;	/* size (in bytes) of the item */
  int offset;		/* offset for struct/union */
  int stkoffs;		/* offset from stack ptr (locsym only)*/
  T_misc misc;		/* initial value */
  int endstmt;		/* marks top of recursive statement (locsym only)*/
  struct list *further;	/* for functions, structs and unions */
  struct entry *prev;	/* ptr to the previous element */
  struct entry *next;	/* ptr to the next element */

  int lval0;		/* for compatibility with heirxx() functions */
  int lval1;		/* should get rid of this.. */
  int lval2;
};

misc is an union holding initial (if any) value of the item:

typedef union {
  char cvalue;
  int ivalue;
  float fvalue;
};

Whenever an item of structured type (struct, union, function, etc)
is to be added to the list its name is entered into the main list.
The members are entered into child list pointed by "further".
The following example of the C code:

	..
	int x;
	int y;
	struct S{
	 int s1;
	 int s2;
	};
	int f(int a, int b);
	..

will produce the following glbsym list:

	..->x->y->S->f->..
	          |  |
	          s1 a
	          |  |
	          s2 b

In this way complex structures can be generated.

While adding new elements, the list is first searched for duplicates.
If none exist the item is added at the list end. glbsym list is searched
from top to bottom and locsym is searched from bottom up to the nearest
endstmt. This simple trick allows the compound statements to use local 
identifiers. When searching for a variable both locsym (firstly) and 
glbsym (secondly) are scanned.  
All static variables are given assembler names identical to C source.
All local variables are referenced with respect to stack pointer (stkp).
Members of structs are referenced as offsets from the base name.
Some arithmetics is needed when calculating offsets especially for
local variables as they appear on the stack in reverse order.


Important constants and variables controlling the compilation.

Entries for "ident":
CONST,VARIABLE,ARRAY,POINTER,FUNCTION,PROTOTYPE,IDENT

Entries for "type":
none,CHAR,INT,FLOAT,VOID,ENUM,STRUCT,UNION

Entries for "storage":
PUBLIC,AUTO,EXTERN,STATIC,LSTATIC,DEFAUTO,TYPEDEF

Statement types (tokens):
STIF,STWHILE,STRETURN,STBREAK,STCONT,STASM,STEXP,STDO,STFOR,STSWITCH
 
NAMEMAX		- size of the idenfier		default: 8
CHARSIZE	- size of the char value	default: 1
INTSIZE		- sizeof the int value		default: 1
ENUMSIZE	- size of the enum value	default: 1
FLOATSIZE	- size of the float value	default: 1
POINTERSIZE	- size of pointer		default: 1

The above values can be changed to accommodate the different needs.
However, the code generation functions must allow reconfiguration. 

LIBDIR		- directory for libraries 	default -"./include"

stkp		- holds the stack pointer value
line[]		- c code input buffer
lptr		- ptr to source text in line
LINESIZE	- size of line buffer

Preprocessor.
The preprocessor operates also using a linked list with the list
item of the form:

typedef struct macentry{
  char *lit;			/* new literal */
  char *def;			/* its expansion */
  struct macentry *next;	/* ptr to the next entry */
};

The list itself is pointed by macstart
Each #define adds an entry into the list, #undef removes it.

Errors and warnings.
The compiler can generate errors, warnings and fatal errors.
Errors are reserved for source code errors (missing ";", etc), warnings
indicate ambiguities while fatals are reserved for internal errors
(not enough memory, file access errors, etc). All messages should be combined
in error.h and should be passed to a particular function by name and not
value (this would allow better message control). For the time being file
error.h is not used.
Error and warning processing has to be verified and rewritten.  

Assembler code generator.
The statement parser is independent from the code generation module.
The compiler generates assembler code for a Virtual Machine (VM). Each VM
instruction in turn generates code for a particular processor. By changing
the VM code the compiler can be ported to support different processors. 
The VM details are described in ASSEMBLE.DOC file.

Include functions.
All functions found in "include" directory are from the original John Favata's
source. I only changed the name of 16C84.h file to c0.s.

Text editor hint.
To write the source code I used text editor (good old WordStar ...)
with tabulator set to 3.
