MediumC. A list of things still to be done..

1. Immediate needs.
* Both structs and unions can be referenced by value only. One should be able
to reference those by address too. This applies also to members:

	struct str{
	  int x;
	  int y;
	};

	struct str a;	//seems OK
	struct str *b;	//asm code needs to be checked

	a.x;		//seems OK
	b->x		//needs to be written

The function processing struct/union members is findmember() found in expr.c.
Although one can define recursive structures findmember() is not able to 
process such variables yet.

* The primary() function needs to be reviewed.

* I still do not fully understand heir() function, and the role of
lval0, lval1 and lval2 values which are still left from the original code.
I would rather use "struct entry" fields instead.

* functions processing global (e.g. dostrun(), etc) and local
(e.g. dostrun1(), etc) unions and structs are very similar. It would be great
to combine them into single functions.

* All error and warning messages should be referenced from error.h.
The error handling code has also to be reviewed. To avoid printing multiple 
errors the erroneous lines should be killed.  

* VM speed/size optimisation has to be rewritten.

2. Next in line needs.
* Support for Microchip/MPP (my own preprocessor) asm code
-when I have more time.

* Support for signed/unsigned data types.
-should be easy.

* Support for 2 byte int arithmetics.
-should be easy.

3. Future needs.
* Support for multidimensional arrays.

* Support for float arithmetics.
-one could adapt some package (AN575?) and develop say 2 or 3 byte float
float library. 

* Support for other than 16x84 PICs.
-basically one needs separate startup code for each chip.

* Creating library functions (stdlib.h, stdio.h, math.h etc..)
Over the years several splendid examples of PIC code were posted to PICLIST.
It would be great to combine this code into libraries.
