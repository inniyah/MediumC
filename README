MediumC PIC-C compiler.
still in development phase.

This package contains the complete C-source code for MediumC PIC-C compiler.

The compiler is based on the original source of John Favata's (favata@cs.buffalo.edu) 
port of SmallC (Ron Cain, Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia, #45)
compiler. The code however is nearly in 90% rewriten from scratch.
It does not compile itself (like SmallC) and is heavily dependent on standard
C libraries. I used Turbo C (v.2.0) to compile the source. 
New compiler features include support for structs, unions, enums, ANSI
function calls and other data types.
As it no more resembles SmallC I would prefer to call it "MediumC".

The initial work was just an academic exercise aimed at some improvement of
John's code. However, as the work progressed I became more and more interested
in writing up just a new compiler. Moreover, I became less and less interested
in PIC asm output (..). What I ended up is (hopefully) a general purpose parser 
with the ability of producing whatever assembler output, providing that 
a suitable set of code generating functions will be provided.

Due to lots of academic work (lectures, labs, etc) I am unable to continue
the design single handed.

I am releasing the source to general public under GNU licence in hope
that there are people who would be able to continue and further improve
the design.  

There is still lots of work and testing to be done. The compiler successfully
compiles simple programs. I have not tested the more elaborate ones.

To compile the source one needs a C compiler and linker (Turbo/Borland C and
tlink). The compilation is performed via make and Makefile. Makefile
has to be edited in order to set up directories and paths to suit individual
environment.

I have included in this package a list of things needed to be done as well
as some technical documentation. You all know that reverse engineering is
a nightmare so please do write lots of comments and make written
documentation (I keep telling my students about documentation..).
Whenever you write up some new code please do let me know, so I can include
your improvements in the "official distribution".

How to compile MediumC compiler.
Unpack the source (use unzip). Edit Makefile to suit your local environment.
You can also edit defs.h to set up include directory.
"make" the compiler. You are done..  

How to compile a PIC program.
The compiler is invoked from the command line with the following syntax:

mcc [-art] [-d<sym>[=<value>]] [-o<OutputFile>] <InputFile>

switches:
-a	- indicate # of args passed into functions 
-r	- trace compiler calls
-t	- append source lines into asm output
-d	- define preprocessor symbol
-o	- specify output file name.

unless -o option is specified the resulting output file has the name identical
to <InputFile> but with the "s" extension.
-t and -r  options are useful only for compiler debugging.  

Exit codes.
On successful compilation the compiler returns ERRORLEVEL 0.
Other exit codes are reserved for various errors (still in development)
